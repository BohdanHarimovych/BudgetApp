# Expense Tracker Application Tech Stack Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the technology stack and architecture for the Expense Tracker application, a mobile-friendly web application designed for tracking and analyzing expenses through CSV imports and interactive dashboards.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend
- **Next.js with App Router**: React framework for building the UI with server-side rendering and API routes
  - Version: Latest stable (14.x)
  - Purpose: Provides efficient routing, server components, and built-in API routes

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - Version: Latest stable (18.x)
  - Purpose: Component-based UI development

- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript
  - Version: Latest stable (5.x)
  - Purpose: Type safety and improved developer experience

### UI Framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
  - Version: Latest stable (3.x)
  - Purpose: Rapidly building custom designs without leaving HTML

- **shadcn/ui**: Component library built on Tailwind CSS
  - Purpose: Consistent, accessible UI components with minimal overhead
  - Benefits: Not a dependency, components are copied into the project for maximum customization

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase**: Open-source Firebase alternative
  - Services used:
    - Database (PostgreSQL)
    - Authentication
    - Storage (for file uploads)
  - Purpose: Serverless backend infrastructure with real-time capabilities

### State Management & Data Fetching
- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: Data fetching and caching library
  - Version: Latest stable (v5)
  - Purpose: 
    - Server state management
    - Caching
    - Background refetching
    - Optimistic updates

### Form Handling & Validation
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management library
  - Version: Latest stable
  - Purpose: Performance-focused form handling with minimal re-renders

- **Zod**: TypeScript-first schema validation
  - Purpose: Form validation and type inference
  - Integration: Used with @hookform/resolvers for React Hook Form

### Data Processing
- **Papa Parse**: CSV parsing library
  - Purpose: Processing uploaded CSV transaction files

### Deployment
- **Vercel**: Cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions
  - Purpose: Production hosting with CI/CD integration
  - Benefits: Optimized for Next.js applications

## Dev Tools
- **ESLint**: JavaScript linting utility
  - Purpose: Code quality and consistency

- **Prettier**: Code formatter
  - Purpose: Consistent code style

- **Cursor**: AI-powered code editor
  - Purpose: AI-assisted development for faster implementation

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User authentication handled by Supabase Auth
   - Auth state managed in React context
   - Protected routes with middleware

2. **Transaction Management Flow**:
   - CSV files uploaded through the UI
   - Processed by API route using Papa Parse
   - Validated with Zod schemas
   - Stored in Supabase database
   - Fetched and cached with TanStack Query

3. **Dashboard Data Flow**:
   - Aggregated transaction data fetched from Supabase
   - Cached with TanStack Query
   - Displayed with interactive UI components

## Performance Considerations
- Server and client components separation for optimal rendering
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading for large components
- Efficient data fetching strategies with TanStack Query
- Incremental Static Regeneration for dashboard pages where appropriate

## Security Considerations
- Row-level security in Supabase
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Input validation on both client and server
- Authentication required for all sensitive operations
- CORS and CSP headers for API protection
