# CSV Transaction Upload Design Approach

Based on your project's tech stack and existing codebase, I'll outline a comprehensive design approach for handling CSV transaction file uploads securely and efficiently.

## Overall Design Approach

The CSV upload feature will follow these high-level steps:
1. User selects and uploads a CSV file through a client-side interface
2. Client validates file format before submission
3. Server-side API receives and processes the file
4. Data is validated, transformed, and inserted into the Supabase database
5. User receives feedback on the import status

## Client-Side Implementation

### UI Components

1. **Upload Component**
   - Create a dedicated upload component using shadcn/ui
   - Include drag-and-drop functionality and file selection button
   - Display file size constraints and supported formats
   - Show uploading state and completion status

2. **Preview Component**
   - Allow users to preview parsed data before confirming import
   - Display column mapping interface if needed
   - Show validation warnings for potential issues

3. **User Feedback**
   - Use Toast notifications for success/error messages
   - Display a progress indicator during upload and processing
   - Show summary statistics after import completion

### Client-Side Data Flow

1. File selection triggers initial client-side validation
2. File is read locally using FileReader API to validate format
3. Valid file is submitted to the API endpoint via FormData
4. UI displays loading state during upload
5. Upon completion, display statistics and confirmation

## Server-Side Implementation

### API Endpoint Enhancement

Enhance the existing `/api/transactions/upload/route.ts` with:

1. **Authentication Enforcement**
   - Use the existing `requireAuth` middleware from `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
   - Ensure user ID is associated with uploaded transactions

2. **File Processing**
   - Use Papa Parse for robust CSV parsing
   - Set appropriate chunk size for large files
   - Process dynamically typed values and map to schema

3. **Data Transformation Pipeline**
   - Parse dates and monetary values correctly
   - Handle category and merchant mapping (create if needed)
   - Format data according to database schema

4. **Batch Database Operations**
   - Group inserts into batches for efficiency
   - Use transactions where appropriate to ensure atomicity
   - Handle potential duplicate detection

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement detailed error reporting
   - Allow partial success with details on which rows failed
   - Log issues for debugging

## Data Processing Flow

1. **Parse CSV File**
   - Use Papa Parse with appropriate options:
     ```typescript
     {
       header: true,
       dynamicTyping: true,
       skipEmptyLines: true,
       transformHeader: (header) => header.trim().toLowerCase()
     }
     ```

2. **Validate Schema**
   - Create a Zod schema for transaction data validation
   - Validate each row against the schema
   - Collect and report validation errors

3. **Process Categories and Merchants**
   - Extract unique categories and merchants from the import
   - Check for existing entries in the database
   - Create new ones as needed using upsert operations

4. **Process Transactions**
   - Map CSV data to transaction schema
   - Associate with user_id
   - Handle date formatting and currency normalization
   - Batch insert into the database

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - Ensure endpoint is protected by middleware
   - Validate user session for every request

2. **Input Validation**
   - Validate file type, size, and content
   - Sanitize all inputs before database operations
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting for upload endpoints
   - Consider file size limits appropriate for the application

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Use database transactions to ensure atomic operations
   - Implement proper error handling and rollback

5. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Log upload attempts with non-sensitive metadata
   - Track errors for security monitoring

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create Upload Component**
   - Implement file input with shadcn/ui components
   - Add drag-and-drop functionality
   - Implement client-side validation

2. **Enhance API Endpoint**
   - Update the route handler to process CSV files
   - Implement Papa Parse integration
   - Add transaction validation logic

3. **Create Database Functions**
   - Implement functions to handle categories and merchants
   - Create batch transaction insertion function

4. **Implement Error Handling**
   - Create error response formats
   - Implement client-side error display

5. **Add Progress Reporting**
   - Implement progress tracking for large files
   - Display import statistics to users

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript Types**
   - Define strict types for all CSV data structures
   - Ensure type safety throughout the processing pipeline

2. **Implement Idempotency**
   - Use transaction IDs or checksums to prevent duplicates
   - Allow for safe retries of failed uploads

3. **Provide Clear Feedback**
   - Show detailed progress during upload
   - Provide clear error messages when validation fails

4. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Process files in chunks for large uploads
   - Use efficient database operations

5. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Various CSV formats and delimiters
   - Special characters and encoding issues
   - Extremely large files

This approach aligns with your existing tech stack, leveraging Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase, Zod, and shadcn/ui components to create a secure, user-friendly CSV upload experience.
