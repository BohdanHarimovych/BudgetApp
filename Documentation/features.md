# Critical Features of the Expense Tracker Application

This document outlines the most critical features of the Expense Tracker application, a mobile-friendly web application designed for tracking and analyzing expenses. These features are central to the application’s functionality, user experience, and value proposition.

## 1. User Authentication
- **Description**: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the application and their personal expense data.
- **Key Components**:
  - Login and registration pages (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`, `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`).
  - Supabase Authentication for managing user sessions and credentials.
  - Authentication state managed via a React context (`src/lib/providers/auth-provider.tsx`).
  - Protected routes using middleware to restrict access to sensitive areas like the dashboard.
- **Why Critical**: Protects user data and ensures personalized expense tracking by associating transactions with individual user accounts.

## 2. Transaction Management

- **Description**: Users can manually add transactions or import them in bulk via CSV uploads, enabling flexible expense tracking.

  - CSV upload endpoint for bulk imports (`src/app/api/transactions/upload/route.ts`).
  - Transaction list and filters for viewing and sorting (`src/components/transactions/transaction-list.tsx`, `src/components/transactions/transaction-filters.tsx`).
  - Supabase database tables (`transactions`, `merchant`, `category`, `transaction_sources`) for storing transaction data.
  - Papa Parse for processing CSV files (`src/lib/utils/csv-parser.ts`).
